The MonoSeb40 is a simple board i made mostly to try making a Monoblock split and to try ZMK and wireless.

It ended up actually being pretty nice to type on!
It's a 40-key 12x4 layout and the keys are angled inwards at 10 degrees.
I wanted to make the board MX spaced, but realized after i sent for the PCBs to be manufactured that it was choc.
