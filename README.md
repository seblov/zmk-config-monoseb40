The MonoSeb40 is a simple board i made mostly to try making a Monoblock split and to try ZMK and wireless.

It ended up actually being pretty nice to type on!
It's a 40-key 12x4 layout and the keys are angled inwards at 10 degrees.
I wanted to make the board MX spaced, but realized after i sent for the PCBs to be manufactured that it was choc.


If you want to make this for yourself, be aware that the PCB is wired for a NiceNano clone and i am not a 100% sure if the pinouts are the same.
Therefore, either get the NiceNano clone or edit the PCB.
